# Fluent UI System Icons (svg)

This package provides the Fluent UI System Icons as SVG sprites, which allow user agents to request and cache icons at runtime instead of depending on this project monolithically.

## Usage

For security reasons, most user agents require the sprites to be served from the same hostname, protocol and port. During development, requests can be proxied to a specific release on e.g. jsdelivr which you have vetted for integrity, a bucket in the cloud, or served from the serviceâ€™s file system.

For Storybook, `middleware.js` allows the configuration of `http-proxy-middleware` like so:

```js
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware')

const expressMiddleWare = (router) => {
  router.use(
    '/sprites',
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fluentui/svg-sprites',
      changeOrigin: true,
      followRedirects: true,
    })
  )
}

module.exports = expressMiddleWare
```

Sprites can then be consumed by the client like so:

```tsx
export const Icon = (props: IconProps) => {
  const { icon, variant = 'regular', size = 20 } = props
  const assetId = `${icon}_${size}_${variant}`
  return (
    <svg>
      <use href={`/sprites/${assetId}.sprite.svg#${assetId}`} />
    </svg>
  )
}
```
