# 1. `production` tag at pipeline level declares that it builds
#     binaries that can ship to external customers.
#
# 2. `multi-phased` tag declares that this is a multi phased build
#     and indicates that the system should look for required steps
#     in individual phases. This tag is important because otherwise
#     the system would look for all tasks in all phases.
