## Icon List

- [View the full list of regular icons](icons_regular.md)

- [View the full list of filled icons](icons_filled.md)


## Direction
Within the metadata.json file for an icon, a property named `directionType` is used to indicate the direction of the icon. This property can have one of the following values:
- `unique`, meaning that the icon is unique and has a specific RTL and LTR version
- `mirror`, meaning that the icon can be mirrored for RTL or LTR languages

The property `singleton` is also used to indicate the default direction that should be used for the icon.
